**Character Commands**
To begin, start by making a new character by typing "new character [CHARACTER NAME]" in a channel with Cocoa. Be sure to replace [CHARACTER NAME] with the actual name of your character. Cocoa will roll characteristics for your character, but you're free to modify them as you like later by typing "edit character".
