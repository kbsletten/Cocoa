**Skill Roll**
`roll <skill> [SKILL NAME] <bonus/penalty>`
This command performs a skill check with a custom skill value and name, using the same logic as named skill checks. Bonuses and penalties will be respected and the degree of success will be returned.

__Example__
*Jane Doe*
```
roll Listen
```
*Cocoa*
```
Jane Doe attempts Listen (20%)!
1d% (20) + 1d10 (0) = 20; Success!
```
