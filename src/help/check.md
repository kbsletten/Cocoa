**Custom Check**
`check [SKILL VALUE] [SKILL NAME] <bonus/penalty>`
This command performs a skill check with a custom skill value and name, using the same logic as named skill checks. Bonuses and penalties will be respected and the degree of success will be returned.

__Example__
*Jane Doe*
```
check 40 Underwater Basket Weaving penalty
```
*Cocoa*
```
Jane Doe attempts Underwater Basket Weaving (40%, Penalty: 1)!
2d% (80, 40) + 1d10 (9) = 89; Failure!
```
